# Liri-Node-App


        What the project does: This project uses Node.js, several packages from 
    NPM, and APIs from Twitter, Spotify, and OMDB. It app takes user input 
    from the command line that allows the user to either search for tweets, 
    songs, or movies. Basic information about their query is then returned 
    to the user.
        In order for a user to run this project they must obtain their own 
    developer keys for Twitter and Spotify. Those have been removed from
    this repository. Keys can be placed in .gitignore files, and then be 
    substituted with variables in the actual code.
        This project contains the logic for a useful media app. It is 
    something that would be worth developing a user interface for.
